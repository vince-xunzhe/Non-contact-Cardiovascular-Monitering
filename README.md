# Non-contact-Cardiovascular-Monitering

<br>
To develop a non-contact and non-invasive pulse waveform acquisition device using laser speckle imaging technique to measure heart rate and radial augmentation index.<br>
Both hardware configurations and softwaew design have been explained in the report.<br>
Control and video Processing are programmed using Python. MATLAB codes also contained to demonstrate the model simulations.

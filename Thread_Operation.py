# If you are intending to perform processing on the frames after capture,
# you may be better off just capturing video and decoding frames from the 
# resulting file rather than dealing with individual JPEG captures. Alternatively, 
# you may wish to investigate sending the data over the network (which typically 
# has more bandwidth available than the SD card interface) and having another 
# machine perform any required processing. However, if you can perform your 
# processing fast enough, you may not need to involve the disk or network at all. 
# Using a generator function, we can maintain a queue of objects to store the 
# captures, and have parallel threads accept and process the streams as captures 
# come in. Provided the processing runs at a faster frame rate than the captures, 
# the encoder wonâ€™t stall:
